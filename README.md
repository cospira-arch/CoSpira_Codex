The CoSpira Codex is a provisional reference document that records not a single conclusion, but an attitude toward agency, information ethics, and relationality in the AI era.

Grounded in the premise of co-subjectivity, the codex treats judgment, responsibility, and meaning as phenomena that never arise in isolation, but always within relations—between humans, technologies, language, institutions, and time. Rather than framing the contemporary condition as “information overload,” it understands the world as an accumulation of unresolved fragments and asks how agency can be preserved without outsourcing judgment to either authority or algorithms.

This document does not propose a doctrine, a belief system, or a finalized theory. It is published as a living, update-oriented codex, explicitly designed to remain provisional. The year label “2026” is not a prediction of future events, but a working assumption: an invitation to behave as if at a turning point, and to consciously choose how judgment and responsibility are handled in the present.

Topics addressed include co-subjectivity, information ethics in the AI era, techno-animism as a non-oracular attitude toward technology, modern magic as a vocabulary of relation rather than control, and the transformation of bias from fear-driven domination into dialogue-driven care.

Fragments, glossaries, and appendices are preserved not as incomplete thoughts to be eliminated, but as traces of discovery that precede formal articulation. Revisions and expansions are expected. Prior versions remain accessible.

This preprint is released as part of the CoSpira Project and is intended to function as a reference point for positioning rather than as an object of agreement.
